- Set up MFA for user login
- Create custom IAM JSON policies that:
+ Restric actions by AWS Region
+ Enforce specific EC2 resource tags
- Define trust relationships so that IAM users can assume the role
- Practice Switch Role operation
- Validate policies though tests
- Clean up roles, policies to avoid excess privilege exposure
- Apply least privilege, control access via conditions (region, tags)	No difficulty in lab	N/A

Goals:
1. LAB PRACTICE:
- Understand the concept, purpose of Permission Boundaries
- Understand the intersection rule: effective permissions are overlap between user policies and permission boundary
- Know how to create and apply Permission Boundary Policies: use JSON policy
- Create and configure a limited IAM User
- Test boundary enforcement via console
- Practice Resource cleanup: remove IAM users, policies
2. STUDY THE THEORY:
- Understanding of core database concepts:
+ Database, Primary key and Foreign Key in RD.
+ The role of indexes, partitions, query plans, database logs
+ The differences between RDBMS v/s No.SQL, OLTP vs OLAP
- Learn how AWS Manages Relational Databases:
+ Use Amazon RDS: Backups, Replication, Security, Scalability
+ Amazon Aurora: High performance, Backtrack, clone,...
- Recognize when to use Amazon Redshift for DW:
+ Built on PostgreSQL, but optimized for OLAP
+ Suppoert MPP architecture: compute and leader nodes.
- Understand how Amazon ElastiCache accelerates data access: supports Redis, Memcached.	No difficulty in lab	N/A

- Configure public IP assignment for subnets to allow internet access for EC2 instances
- Create Securit Groups: for EC2, RDS
- Build a DB Subnet group to support multi-AZ RDS deployemnts for high availability and fault tolerance
- Clone and deploy an app from GitHub on an EC2 instance.
- Install Node.js (through nvm), common library (Express, dotenv, body-parser)
- Configure package.json and script npm start to deploy a simple app
- Install and configure MySQL Server locally (or via RDS) using dnf
- Create an RDS instance (MySQL/SQL Server), know how to configure credentials and security, connect it to EC2.

- Set up alarms with Amazon CloudWatch to be notified when critical thresholds are reached.
- Clean up resources: RDS instances, snapshots, EC2, custom VPCs, related resources (SG, NAT Gateway, Route Tables)	EC2 can’t connect to RDS	- Allow inbound traffic on port 3306 (MySQL)/ 1433 (SQL Server) from EC2 SG
(not just an IP).
